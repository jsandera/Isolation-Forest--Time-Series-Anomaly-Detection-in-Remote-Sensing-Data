# Isolation-Forest--Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection-in-Remote-Sensing-Data

This repository is part of Ph.D. research project in order to find anomalies in time series of remote sensing data (Sentinel 2 satellite).
Detection of anomalies is concentrated on detecting abnormalities in spectral response of many biological varibles (LAI, FAPAR etc.)
for the main purpose of mapping changes from grasslands to arable lands.
